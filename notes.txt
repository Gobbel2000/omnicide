Final products:

ICBMs for use in rocket silos. 
^Possibly MRBM/IMRBM as well.
Nuclear artillery shells for use in artillery turrets and atillery wagons. 
Handheld nuclear rockets for use in rocket launchers, just like the vanilla nuke.

Possibly integration with aircraft mod for air-launched bombs, that cannot be launched by a hand-held rocket launcher. Another option would be to let the player launch all nuclear rockets by hand, even if they unavoidably kill themselves. I like that idea actually. 


Bomb tiers

Fission

Uranium bomb
Plutonium bomb
Plutonium-Uranium bomb??

Fusion

Boosted Fusion bomb
Hydrogen bomb
Fission-Fusion-Fission bomb
Three-stage fusion bomb
Neutron bomb?? probably not, because no fallout mechanic will be implemented
MIRV = multiple warheads in one rocket (ICBM)




Intermediate parts

Raw warheads that can quickly be crafted into ICBM payloads for rocket silo launch, artillery shells or rockets. There won't always be all three options for every type of warhead.

Different fuel cores, multiple of which are used in some warhead types:
- Uranium-235
- Uranium-238
- Plutonium
- Hydrogen (Tritium)
	- probably in form of Lithium

Shaped charges to trigger the Fission reaction, because just explosives aren't complex enough. 

Remote launch control items for each of: ICBM (given on launch?), Atillery shells (really? for every bomb type? Maybe don't make that many artillery options then)


Standard ingredients:

radar
RCU
Modules, for huge complexity
steel
some circuitery
explosives/HE
tamper, maybe out of copper, because why not
