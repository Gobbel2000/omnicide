FISSION
--------------------

Pure Uranium 235, Gun-assembly, easiest, example Hiroshima: 64.1kg U 235

Only U 235 is useful for Gun-type. Plutonium starts reaction too early. 


Pure Plutonium (239), implosion, more difficult to build, 6.2kg Pu --> 21-23kt, example Nagasaki (21kt)

Implosion-type can also be done with U 235, as well as with Pu 239

Simple Implosion is very large, too large for ARTILLERY!
But, Two-Point Detonation reduces overall diameter, Pu CAN fit in an Artillery shell (as well as U here)
That's why TPD is way popular. 

When you're bluffing about your arsenal:
"I'll hit hit you with a bomb made powerful by Plutonium!"
"no, U"
(I'm so sorry)



--------------------
BOOSTED WEAPONS
--------------------

Fusion fuel (Deuterium/Tritium) inside fission core for better/faster/more efficient fission
255kt-45.5kt in tests, broadly used. 




-------------------- 
FUSION: THERMONUCLEAR WEAPONS
--------------------

Two stages: primary fission to start the fusion reaction
secondary fusion as a second core

has some plastics between the cores

Fusion Fuel: liquid deuterium, must be kept below boiling point of -250Â°C. 
later solid lithium deuteride fuel, tritium bred during fission
the tritium fuses with the deuterium
